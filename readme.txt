Title 
A healthy comparison between Logistic regression and Random forest techniques to predict the Rain for tomorrow


Description
“Will it rain tomorrow? “ is one of the most asked question asked by most of us, everyday on every single area across the face of the world. 
In this project we attempt to predict the rain for tomorrow classification problem using Logistic regression and Random Forest techniques and
compare them later using Parislab @ UCLA  model .There has been many Machine learning classification models predicting the rain based on various 
attributes of temperature, windflaw, direction, cloud position etc. but since there has been very few attempts to predict the same using the average 
humidity and pressure recorded on the said day we set the goal of predicting the rain using the two attributes alone

Getting Started

Dependencies
Windows 11 Home 64 bit 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz   2.30 GHz processir 
Anaconda navigator3
Python 3.0 and above
Torch '1.7.1+cpu' 
Numpy
Pandas
tqdm
Seabon
pylab
matplotlib
sklearn and all its libraries and dependancies
missingno
joblib
 

Installing

Windows OS will be pres installed .
Anaconda navigator ide comes a afree download from the internet.
torch version and all other libraries can be downloaded from the internet. using pip commands
Online trail version cannot run all codes effectively.
configuring GPu to pytorch is highly recommned.


WHere to find the programs:
Main executivable folders are all located in the single ZIP file named INM427 Neural networking coursework


To Execute program

1.Open Anaconda navigator 
2.Open Jupyter notebook
3.click on new notebook based on the choosen kernal
4.PIp Installing and conda install all the said librabries 
5.Using pandas and Import weatherAUS dataset
6.Execute program
7.Two models and two excel files saved for testing.  
8.Two models names SVMmodel for the SVM processed model and MLP model for the MLP processed model
9.Two CSV files saved one is X test the features and Y test the target variable.
10.Open the testing notebook.ipynb Load 
11.Run code for the considtion matrix.
12.The MLP takes tensors for input and the SVM takes arrays for input.To be noted.
13.During rerniing make sure to give different names for the models.
14.A project report in PDF is provided along with the noteookALAB are implented and Confusion matrix and ROC curves are identified later.


Help
1.The directory of the file should be kep constant for thre proper run.

2.The training in both MLP and in SVM takes hours.Maintain the notebook in live confitiona nd kernal alive wehn theyh are running.
